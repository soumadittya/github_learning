When the code of local repository and the code of remote repository are 
not same then before pushing the new code to the remote repository git 
expects us to pull the changes from the remote repository first and then 
merge it with the local repository.

But in case if we want to ovverride the remote repository code with our 
local repository code then we can use the following command.

    Command:
    git push -f origin branch_name
    ('-f' will override the remote repository code with the local repository code.)
