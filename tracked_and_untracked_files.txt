After using the command 'git add' git gets to know about the files.
(But are not added to the repository)

Files in your Git repository folder can be in one of 2 states:

  1. Tracked - files that Git knows about and are added to the repository. (after using 'git add' command)
  2. Untracked - files that are in your working directory, but not added to the repository. (before using 'git add command')
  
 When you first add files to an empty repository ('git add' command has not been used), they are all untracked. 
 To get Git to track them, you need to stage them (use 'git add' command to stage the files), or add them to the staging environment.
